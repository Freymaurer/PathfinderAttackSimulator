Web Application for PathfinderAttackSimulator
---------------------------------------------------------

<div class="row">

Most people i play with do not have any experience in programming, thats why they shy away from using this toolbox.
So i started working on a web application so everyone can easily use all tools without having to download a code editor.
The web application is not yet finished, but i want to present you the progress so far. If you have feedback or just feel 
like i have no idea what i am doing, feel free to open an issue [here](https://github.com/Freymaurer/PathfinderWebApp/issues).

Above you can see the general layout. A click on "Open new Attack Calculator tab"(1) will add a new "Attack Calculator"(2) element to the page.
A click on the "hide/show"(3) button will open up the attack calculator tab.
