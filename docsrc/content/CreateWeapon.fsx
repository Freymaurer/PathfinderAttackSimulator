Creating a Weapon
======================

Example on how a Weapon should be created.
-------

A weapon needs certain informations for a correct calculation. 
Right now this is not hand-held at all, but might get better in a future version.

Let's start with an easy example a +2 keen flaming greatsword

### +2 Keen Flaming Greatsword
*)

#r "PathfinderAttackSimulator.dll"
open PathfinderAttackSimulator.Library.AuxLibFunctions

let keenflaming2greatsword = {
        Name                = "+2 keen flaming greatsword"
        Damage              = createDamage 2 6 Slashing
        DamageBonus         = 2
        ExtraDamage         = createDamage 1 6 Fire
        BonusAttackRolls    = 2
        CriticalRange       = [|17 .. 20|] 
        CriticalModifier    = 2
        Modifier            = createUsedModifier Strength Strength TwoHanded 1.5
        ManufacturedOrNatural = Manufactured
        Description         = ""
        }

The most difficult part might actually be to think of a nice name for the type-binding, as you can't start with a number.
Because a weapon is a type it is really easy to handle, as you can just dot into the weapon name if you are unsure if you made some mistake creating the weapon.
*)

let showName = sprintf "The name of this weapon is: %A." keenflaming2greatsword.Name

(*** include-value:showName ***)

let showDamageDie = sprintf "This weapon uses %Ad%A for its damage calculation." keenflaming2greatsword.Damage.NumberOfDie keenflaming2greatsword.Damage.Die 

(*** include-value:showDamageDie ***)

Now to explain the different categories:

* Name = the actual correct name of the weapon, currently not relevant for the code
* Damage = the core weapon damage for 2d6 slashing this needs to be "createDamage 2 6 Slashing"
* DamageBonus = enhancement bonus to dmg
* ExtraDamage = Damage that will be calculated and displayed separately, e.g. 1d6 fire from flaming
* BonusAttackRolls = enhancement bonus to attack roll
* CriticalRange = all rolled dice, representing a crit
* CriticalModifier = currently just displayed and not automatically calculated
* Modifier = the modifier used to hit something, to calculate damage, either OneHanded or TwoHanded and the multiplicator for dmg in this order.
* ManufacturedOrNatural = either Manufactured or Natural, this is necessary for a correct fullround attack action.
